            <h2>First Private Spacecraft to the Space Station</h2>
            <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments.</p>
            <p>It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew.</p>
            <p><em>Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018!</em></p>

Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.</li>
                    <li>VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.</li>

                <p>SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.</p>
                <p>SpaceX has designed these systems from the ground up using the best of modern technology. The Falcon 9, which will launch the Dragon to low-Earth orbit, uses SpaceX-designed Merlin LOX/RP-1 engines, with nine in the first stage and one in the second stage.</p>
                <p>Dragon is designed to not only take cargo to the ISS, but also bring back cargo and experiment samples to Earth. It is the only cargo craft that can do that.</p>
