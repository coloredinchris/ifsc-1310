          <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
          <p>Progressive enhancement is a method of web development that builds content in layers. The most central layer is the core content and it is made up of HTML. One should think of this as the foundational information. The next layer contains enhancements to the layout. It essentially pretties up the website with CSS. The final layer adds enhanced behavior with unobtrusive, externally linked Javascript. In fact, the key to progressive enhancement is to separate your HTML, CSS, and JS files. The idea is to slowly add on more and more from each layer as each individual user's internet and system allows. This lets anyone on any browser access the basic content of your webpage. It also caters to advanced systems by offering a more stylized and interactive view to users with systems capable of handling it. All in all, it allows more users to access your website in a meaningful way, ensuring your website gets more traffic.</p>
          <p>This is opposed to the graceful degradation perspective, which puts almost all of the emphasis onto the newest, cutting edge browsers while playing lip service to the older browsers. This excludes a lot of individuals from being able to utilize your website in a meaningful way and thus, would lose one a lot of traffic.</p>
          <p>It is clear that that progressive enhancement is the superior method of web development since it ensures that more individuals are likely to utilize your website.</p>

          <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
          <p>Throughout this semester I have learned many new skills and improved upon some that I already had. Prior to this class I had very little experience with HTML and CSS, having only played with them a little on the Android app called <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>. Since then, I have gone from barely understanding web design to feeling I have a solid enough understanding of it to continue to grow on my own and begin to market my skills. Beyond just expanding my knowledge of HTML and CSS greatly, I have also begun to dip my toes into understanding JavaScript. With these three languages in my tool belt, I am able to craft a solid foundation, beautify that foundation, and then give it all functionality and purpose. While I still have a long way to go, I feel that I am now well-rounded in creating a website; where before I felt unable to make much more than some blocks of text with some links in them.</p>
          <p>The Dragon Project is the pinnacle of my time in this semester. All of my other projects up until this point have simply been a means to practice this final project in segments. Thus, this is an accumulation of all of the skills I have learned thus far put into practical use. It was my best attempt to create a professional website with the time-frame and skills I was presented with over this semester.</p>
          <p>After my first draft of the Dragon Project, I allowed a few people to look over my website and give me feedback. The things that they wanted to change were all within my grasp except for one. I was told the Contact Us page was unappealing because of the logo and white banner caused by Wufoo. I was unable to find any way to remove this information and decided it was best to accept that it might not look the best, as it would not be particularly ethical to remove a banner and logo in a sold product and I did not have the proper funding to pay for it's removal via the proper avenues.
          <h3>Besides this, I was asked to:</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li class="change-font">Add a gradient to the header background image so that it would blend better with the starry black background below it</li>
            <li class="change-font">Add an interactive "back to top" button that is fixed to the screen but only appears after the user has scrolled down a reasonable distance</li>
            <li class="change-font">Add an interactive navigation bar that is fixed to the screen but only appears after the user has scrolled up or upon initially loading the page.</li>
            <li class="change-font">Add some videos for a more professional presentation</li>
            <li class="change-font">Make the FAQ section a little less bland</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I was successfully able to implement all of these requests, as well as added some things of my own like an automatically scrolling slideshow and pictures that enlarge when hovered over on the home page. I did not implement enlarging images within the slideshow as I ran into complications trying to implement them there. Furthermore, I added the image enlargement function so that it would look nicer on my 2K monitor; the slideshow enlarges on its own for monitors of this resolution and makes it unnecessary to enlarge images within the slideshow. The image enlargement was done via HTML and CSS by specifying how large the image should appear when hovered over. The automatically scrolling slideshow required some JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS to create a nice slideshow that flows on its own without user interaction.</p>
          <p>The requests from my chosen beta-testers, were mostly easy to implement. The users wanted me to add a gradient, which was as simple as adding some minor CSS and adding the videos also only took some minor HTML and CSS adjustments. However, the other requests took a little bit more work on my part. To make the FAQ less bland I chose to use a rocket emoji as the details/summary marker. I then utilized CSS to rotate the rocket when it is closed and opened with a smooth transition. This makes it seem like the rocket is unfolding the summary and I felt added a nice flair to the website.</p>
          <p>Making an interactive navigation bar and "back to top" button that only appear when the user is scrolling in specified directions took the most work to implement. It reuqired some use of JavaScript to manipulate classes and to force the bar and button off the screen when scrolling in a specified direction. In this scenario I had to watch a few videos to really understand what each level of JavaScript code was doing so that I could change it to fit with my already established HTML and CSS. This was difficult, but now I am confident I could implement these features just about anywhere on a website.</p>
